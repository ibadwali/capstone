Capstone Project
This Capstone Project requires learners to work with the following technologies to manage an ETL process for a Loan Application dataset and a Credit Card dataset: Python (Pandas, advanced modules, e.g., Matplotlib), SQL, Apache Spark (Spark Core, Spark SQL), and Python Visualization and Analytics libraries. Learners are expected to set up their environments and perform installations on their local machines.
